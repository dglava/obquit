# OBquit configuration file
# User specific configuration files should be placed in ~/.config/obquit/obquit.conf
# Otherwise the system wide setting will be sourced from /etc/obquit/obquit.conf
# In case neither of them is available, built-in defaults are used.

# Each line will add a button to the logout screen.
# The command name will be displayed in the label below the button,
# so you can add your own description.
[Commands]

# any effect - it will be disregarded. Make sure to have the same command
# name under [Commands] and [Shortcuts].
