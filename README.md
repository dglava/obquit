# obquit
Utility script for logging out of a session, inspired by Oblogout.

##### Dependencies
* Python 3
* PyGObject
* Python-Cairo

##### What works
- custom command assignment for the various actions (uses systemd's systemctl by default)
- supports real (when using a compositor) and fake (doesn't need a compositor) transparency

##### What needs improvement
- probably a lot of stuff
