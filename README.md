# obquit
Utility script for logging out of a session, inspired by Oblogout.

##### Dependencies (Arch package names)
* python (Python 3)
* python-gobject
* python-cairo
* gtk3

##### What works
- custom command assignment (uses systemd's systemctl by default)
- supports real (when using a compositor) and fake (doesn't need a compositor) transparency
- keyboard shortcuts

##### What needs improvement
- probably a lot of stuff

##### How to use
`python setup.py install`
